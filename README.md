# HeatMap

create HeatMap image from csv-Data (as provided from survstat.rki.de)
with different colormaps and colorschemes

more or less external Scheme-models - I like my idea to realize this.
configurable by classic Unix-config style

Example-scripts for running: 1 to use the Modules, one to make it easy.

NEW in 1.40 : added scripts for downloading CSV-Data from survstat.rki.de
(cupypara+cucumber+ruby)

2Do:
- info-&error strings prepare for different language 
- 3. scheme : calculate color not by map, but by formula
- change font-writing directions (Schrift hochkant stellen - testen)
