# HeatMap

create HeatMap image from csv-Data (as provided from survstat.rki.de)
with different colormaps and colorschemes

more or less external Scheme-models - I like my idea to realize this.
configurable by classic Unix-config style
Example-scripts for running: 1 to use the Modules, one to make ist easy.

2Do:
- Errorhandling - some places
- add general Errorhandling! don't forget everything with external data that could go wrong!
- info-&error strings prepare for different language 

- 3. scheme : calculate color not by map, but by formula

- change font-writing directions (Schrift hochkant stellen - testen)
